# amen
A toolbox for algorithmic remixing, after Echo Nest Remix.

# Installation
Amen is pretty simple, but it stands on top of some complex stuff.

If you're a serious Python nerd, you can just get it from pip:  `pip install amen`.

If not, read on for faster, more user-friendly installation process.

First, you should install Anaconda, (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which will get you all of the dependencies.

Then, install via pip:  `pip install amen`.

# Testing the Installation
After installation is finished, run `python amen/examples/reverse.py amen/examples/audio/amen./wav`.
Play the resulting `reversed.wav` file, and you're on your way!

# Platforms
Amen is developed on Ubuntu 14.04 and higher.  OS X is probably workable.  Windows users should install Ubuntu.
