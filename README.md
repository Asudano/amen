# amen
A toolbox for algorithmic remixing, after Echo Nest Remix.

# Installation
Via pip:  `pip install amen`

Installing Anaconda first (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) may make things faster.

After installation is finished, run `python amen/examples/reverse.py amen/examples/audio/amen./wav`.
Play the resulting `reversed.wav` file, and you're on your way.
